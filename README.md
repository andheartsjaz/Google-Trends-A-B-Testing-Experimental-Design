# Google-Trends-A-B-Testing-Experimental-Design
**Topic: Big Data Utilization<br>Research Proposal: Approved 12/09/19<br>Proposal Grade: 10/10**<br>
**Tools**:
 - python, numpy, scipy, seaborn and pandas
 - filtering, grouping, sorting
 - aggregations, descriptive stats
 - tests for statistical significance

**Hypothesis**:
- <i>Has interest in Data Scientists increased?</i>
[Primary Query](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2012-01-01%202019-12-01&geo=US&q=data%20scientist)
- <i>Has interest in Data Scientists increased since the Harvard Business Review article of Oct. 2012?</i>
[HBR article](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)

**Proposal**: 
>>I plan to test this hypothesis by comparing the mean interest level by year, business quarter, month and, week. Next, I will perform a t-test to test for significance of the differences in means. Since our data is normalized…we can perform further parametric tests on the difference in meant interest-level across time-series categories.
>>This research can help validate the use and efficacy of Google Trends data as an accurate reflection of the population at large.  Due to the highly specialized nature of this occupation, obtaining validity on the progress of its establishment into the normal labor canon could suppress the rampant cases of Imposter Syndrome that has been well-documented  Perhaps a call to action to others in the field to continue urging them to write about their research and experiences. 
>>I believe the following would be interested in my research: The tech community, educators, businesses, job-seekers, enthusiasts and competitive researchers. With intention, I’d hope that my audience gains: insight into the voice of the nation, closure for professionals who have changed careers, and more than anything, a sense of purpose.
